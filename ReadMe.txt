The first choice a user is given is to start using an empty database, a database with the stored memory of their last use, or a new database with 25 movies already in it. 
The user will type in either “A”,  “B”, or “C” and press enter to indicate his or her choice. Then the user is given the main menu with the following options:

A: Change a customer's information
B: Add a new customer to the database
C: Add a movie to the database
D: View/Delete a movie from the database
E: Watch movie - Search database by movie release date
F: Watch movie - Search database by movie ID number
G: Display entire database in order of release date
Q: Quit menu

If the user chooses A, they will be prompted for a name, credit card, and email and then a new customer with this information is added to the database

If the user chooses B, they will be prompted for the last four digits of a credit card that is used as the key for customers then brought to this menu:
(A) Change Name
(B) Update Email
(C) Update Credit card number
(D) View wish list
(E) Add a movie to your wish list
(F) Delete a movie from your wish list
(G) Watch a movie on your wishlist
(Q) Log out/Go back to main menu
All of the options are pretty self explanatory, the most complex being G which allows the user to watch a movie from their wish list. Once they have watched the movie, they are able to delete it if they want. 

If the user chooses C, they can add a movie to the database by inputting a title, release date, ID, and Rotten Tomatoes score.

If the user chooses D, they will be shown the movie with the worst Rotten Tomatoes score. Then they will be given the option to delete it from the database.

If the user chooses E or F,  They will be prompted to input either release date or ID number of a movie, when they find it they will be able to watch it if they would like to. 

If the user chooses G, all the movies are printed out in order of release date.

If the user chooses Q, the changes that were made will save and the program will end.
